        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>This <a href="https://github.com/amaansaigal/Ensemble-Learning-for-Stock-Price-Prediction">repository</a> is dedicated to predicting the stock prices of Tesla (TSLA), or any other desired stock, using ensemble learning methods, namely Bagging and AdaBoost. The goal is to utilize historical stock data to forecast future prices and evaluate the predictive power of these models.

        <p>This <a href="https://github.com/amaansaigal/Portfolio-Optimization-Analysis">repository</a> contains a Jupyter Notebook and associated data files for a portfolio optimization analysis project. The project applies quantitative techniques to determine the optimal asset allocation that maximizes returns for a given level of risk. The analysis involves simulating numerous portfolio combinations of various stocks or mutual funds to create a risk-return plot, identifying the portfolio with the minimum volatility, and the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe Ratio, indicating the optimal risk-adjusted return.

                <li><strong>S&P 500 ESG Risk Ratings Analysis:</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    This project presents an in-depth analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk ratings among S&P 500 companies. Using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy, I explored and statistically analyzed the dataset to understand ESG risk distribution and trends.<br>

<!-- Data exploration section -->

    <div id="proj3" class="edu-content" style="display:none;">
        <h3>Exploration to Visualization</h3>
        <p>I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear insights. Leveraging pandas and numpy, I refine and analyze data, ensuring it's clean and structured. With matplotlib, and its counterparts like seaborn and plotly, I craft visual narratives that make data interpretation intuitive. This section encapsulates my journey through data cleaning, manipulation, and the art of visualization, showcasing my ability to turn raw data into actionable intelligence.

        <br>
        <p>I've crafted a sophisticated Solana derivative model using the European Black-Scholes formula, integrated with Monte Carlo simulation techniques. This robust approach allowed me to accurately price the derivative, taking into account the volatility and unique characteristics of the Solana cryptocurrency. I also generated and visualized key Greeks such as Vega, Rho, and Delta, providing deep insights into how the derivative's price is sensitive to various market factors. Through this model, investors can better understand the risk profile and potential price movements of the derivative. <a href="https://github.com/amaansaigal/Computational-Methods-for-Finance">(link)</a>
