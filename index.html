                <img src="/assets/images/personal_summary.png" alt="Personal Summary">
                <p>
                    As an Economics graduate with a keen interest in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, I've dedicated my career to understanding the intricate balance between economic growth and sustainable practices. My journey in financial technologies has been driven by a vision to integrate data analysis and science into the heart of climate-focused decision-making.<br><br>
                    Leveraging a strong foundation in quantitative and statistical analysis, I've honed my Python scripting skills to not only interpret complex datasets but also to predict market trends with an added layer of climate and sustainability metrics. My work in portfolio optimization and management is underscored by a deep-seated ambition to demystify financial data, providing a holistic view of market dynamics through the lens of ESG and sustainable finance.<br><br>
                    With a commitment to continual learning, I am expanding my technical expertise into the realms of web development â€“ mastering HTML and CSS to communicate insights more dynamically, as evidenced by this very website. My ongoing projects in data analysis and quantitative modeling are a testament to an ever-evolving skill set, aimed at being at the forefront of tech-savvy solutions in the climate domain.<br><br>
                    Above all, it's the intersection of ESG principles and quantitative data where I find my passion and purpose, striving to become a catalyst for change in an increasingly data-driven world.
                </p>
