## About Me

### Summary

As an *Economics* graduate with a keen interest in *Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors*, I've dedicated my career to understanding the intricate balance between economic growth and sustainable practices. My journey in *financial technologies* has been driven by a vision to integrate *data analysis and science* into the heart of climate-focused decision-making.

Leveraging a strong foundation in *quantitative and statistical analysis*, I've honed my **Python scripting skills** to not only interpret complex datasets but also to predict market trends with an added layer of climate and sustainability metrics. My work in *portfolio optimization and management* is underscored by a deep-seated ambition to demystify financial data, providing a holistic view of market dynamics through the lens of ESG and sustainable finance.

With a commitment to continual learning, I am expanding my technical expertise into the realms of web development â€“ mastering **HTML and CSS** to communicate insights more dynamically, as evidenced by this very website. My ongoing projects in *data analysis* and *quantitative modeling* are a testament to an ever-evolving skill set, aimed at being at the forefront of tech-savvy solutions in the climate domain.

Above all, it's the intersection of **ESG principles and quantitative data** where I find my passion and purpose, striving to become a catalyst for change in an increasingly data-driven world.
